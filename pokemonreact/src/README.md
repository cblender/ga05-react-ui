#PokéReact
###A React UI
By Chris Blendermann

##Introduction: 
PokéReact is a React-based UI that leverages the PokéAPI to display information about all 151 Pokémon in the Kanto region (also known as "Generation 1" pokémon.)

##Current Issues:
- The Pokédex entry for a given pokemon doesn't disappear when you click on another Pokémon index.  You always have to close it manually.
